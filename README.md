# 🔌 Smart Energy Management System

## 📝 Project Summary

The Smart Energy Management System is designed to combat inadvertent energy wastage in residential settings by automatically managing electrical appliances such as lights and fans. Using an Arduino microcontroller, the system leverages real-time data from:

🌡 LM35 temperature sensor  
💡 LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) for light intensity detection  

Based on sensor inputs, the system autonomously:
- Adjusts fan speed and light intensity  
- Tracks real-time energy consumption and tariff  
- Activates a relay cutoff mechanism and buzzer alert when usage crosses set thresholds  

## ⚡ Key Features

📉 **Energy Optimization**: Automatically turns off or adjusts appliances to reduce unnecessary power usage  
📊 **Energy Monitoring**: Tracks and displays real-time energy usage and tariff rates  
⚠️ **Overconsumption Alerts**: Notifies users and cuts off power when limits are exceeded  
☀️ **Solar Monitoring Support**: Measures solar panel voltage, light intensity, and temperature, enhancing sustainability  

## 🌍 Sustainability Integration

The system promotes renewable energy adoption by integrating solar power monitoring, helping reduce dependency on conventional sources and contributing to environmental conservation.
